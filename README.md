Simple online store


## Tech Stack

- Firebase.
- Firestore.
- Firebase cloud functions (Firestore hooks).
- Firestore rules testing using emulators.
- Web components (Lit Element).
- Mocha

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```
## Dev Server



To run the dev server and open the project in a new browser tab:


```bash
npm run dev


```

To run cloud function



```bash
cd functions
npm run dev


```


## Build



This sample uses the TypeScript compiler to produce JavaScript that runs in modern browsers.



To build the JavaScript version of your component:



```bash
npm run build

```

To watch files and rebuild when the files are modified, run the following command in a separate shell:



```bash
npm run build:watch


```

Both the TypeScript compiler and lit-analyzer are configured to be very strict. You may want to change `tsconfig.json` to make them less strict.



## Testing



Tests can be run with the `test` script:



```bash
npm run test
```


```

```
